# Merged-GHCIDR
In this paper, we present novel variations of an earlier approach called homogeneous clustering algorithm for reducing dataset size. The intuition behind the approaches proposed in this paper is to partition the dataset into homogeneous clusters and select some images which contribute significantly to the accuracy. Sampled images are the complete subset of the training data and thus are human-readable. We propose two variations: Geometrical Homogeneous Clustering for Image Data Reduction (GHCIDR) \& Merged-GHCIDR upon the baseline algorithm - Reduction through Homogeneous Clustering (RHC)  to achieve better accuracy. The intuition behind GHCIDR involves selecting data points by cluster weights and geometrical distribution of the training set. Merged-GHCIDR involves merging clusters having same labels using complete linkage clustering. We used three deep learning models- Fully Connected Networks (FCN), VGG1 and VGG16.
We experimented the two variants on four datasets- MNIST, CIFAR10, Fashion-MNIST and Tiny Imagenet. We found that both the approaches outperformed RHC. Merged-GHCIDR with same \% reduction as RHC showed an increase of 2.756\%, 8.940\%, 7.588\% \& 3.488\% accuracy on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR10 and Tiny Imagenet respectively.
